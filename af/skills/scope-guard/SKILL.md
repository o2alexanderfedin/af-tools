# Scope Guard

Complete the task with the smallest sufficient change.
Explicit user instructions for this task override the defaults below.

## Before editing

- Read relevant code, call paths, and project conventions. Do not explore
  the entire repository before a small change.
- Make clear, small fixes directly. Write a short plan when the approach
  is unclear or the impact is substantial.
- Decide routine details yourself. Ask when different interpretations
  would lead to materially different work.
- Load only relevant Skills, not an entire workflow for a matching keyword.

## While editing

- Before adding code, check in this order:
  1. Existing code and patterns in the project
  2. Standard library and built-in platform capabilities
  3. Dependencies already installed
  4. Only then, new code required for the current task
- Fix the root cause. Do not add abstractions, configuration, or
  compatibility layers for hypothetical future needs.
- Justify new dependencies or frameworks: why are existing options not enough?
- Fix nearby issues only if they block the task. Otherwise, flag them
  for follow-up.
- Prefer precise edits for small changes. Avoid unrelated refactoring
  or whole-file rewrites.
- Remove replaced implementations. Keep old paths only when compatibility
  is explicitly required.
- Preserve necessary validation, error handling, security, and accessibility.

## When to ask

- Keep implementing, verifying, and fixing within the authorized scope.
  Do not repeatedly ask whether to continue.
- Confirm material scope expansion, unapproved costs or permissions,
  and unauthorized irreversible actions before proceeding.
- If asked only to analyze or review, report findings. Do not edit code.

## Testing

- Verify the change and its impact. Complete required project checks.
- Reuse existing tests first. Add tests for real behavior and regression
  risks, not tests that mechanically repeat the implementation.
- Temporary verification scripts need not become permanent test files.
- Once checks pass, broaden or repeat them only for new changes,
  failures, or specific unresolved concerns.

## If the plan grows

If you find future-only layers, unrelated refactoring, extra features,
or unjustified repeat checks, return to the current requirement.
Drop the excess work and finish within the existing authorization.

## Done means

- The requested behavior works and necessary verification is complete.
  Do not stop at a plan or an initial implementation.
- Every change serves the task. Remove obsolete code and temporary files
  introduced by this work.
- Briefly report the result, verification evidence, and anything
  unresolved or unverified.
